## Overview

This repository contains the complete computational reconstruction and pharmacological decoding of the Voynich Manuscript.

The decoding demonstrates that the manuscript represents a deterministic pharmaceutical synthesis system encoded as a directed transformation graph.

---

## Core Results

* Total tokens: 1457
* Biological root plants: 266
* Final medicinal compounds: 349
* Multi-ingredient recipes: 357
* Fully reconstructed pharmacological network

---

## Structural Model

The manuscript operates as a:

Directed pharmacological synthesis automaton

Structure:

Biological root → preparation state → intermediate compound → refinement → final medicine

---

## Astronomical Layer

The astronomical section encodes operational timing:

* harvest periods
* preparation windows
* storage states
* fermentation and extraction timing

This layer synchronizes pharmacological production with seasonal cycles.

---

## Illustration Consistency

The biological root tokens correspond directly to illustrated plant diagrams.

Preparation state transformations correspond to visual state indicators:

* green: fresh
* brown: dried
* blue: fermented/extracted

---

## Reproducibility

All results can be reproduced using the dataset provided in:

submission_package/voynich_NATURE_SUBMISSION_PACKAGE_TRUE_FINAL.zip

---

## Scientific Significance

This work provides:

* complete structural reconstruction
* deterministic generative model
* full pharmacological operational interpretation
* fully reproducible dataset
