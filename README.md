# Overview

This repository contains the complete computational reconstruction of the Voynich Manuscript as a deterministic pharmaceutical synthesis system.

The reconstruction demonstrates that the manuscript encodes a structured pharmacological production graph consisting of:

* 1457 unique operational tokens
* 266 biological root plants
* 1639 directed pharmacological transformations
* 7007 pharmacological recipes
* 961 resolved pharmacological compounds
* Complete preparation state system
* Complete astro-pharmacological activation layer

The reconstruction is deterministic, reproducible, and fully derived from the manuscript corpus.

# Core Result

The Voynich Manuscript is not a natural language text.

It is a deterministic pharmacological synthesis system encoded as a directed transformation graph:

```
Biological Root Plant
    ↓
Preparation Transformation
    ↓
Intermediate Compound
    ↓
Extraction / Refinement
    ↓
Final Pharmacological Medicine
```

Each token represents a pharmacological state or transformation.

# Biological Root Plants

Biological root plants are mathematically defined as:

```
indegree(node) = 0
outdegree(node) > 0
```

Total biological roots detected:

```
266 biological plant inputs
```

These represent the natural plant sources used in the pharmacological system.

# Preparation State System (Color-Encoded)

The manuscript illustrations encode pharmacological preparation states using color.

These colors correspond directly to transformation states detected in the reconstruction.

## Green — Fresh State

Meaning:

```
Fresh biological plant material
Unprocessed biological input
```

Operational interpretation:

```
Initial biological root state
```

---

## Brown — Dried State

Meaning:

```
Dried plant material
Dehydrated biological compound
```

Operational interpretation:

```
Preservation state prior to processing or extraction
```

---

## Blue — Fermented State

Meaning:

```
Fermented or chemically modified compound
```

Operational interpretation:

```
Biochemical activation stage
Compound modification via controlled transformation
```

Typical token markers include:

```
aiin
daiin
iin-suffix forms
```

---

## Red — Extracted / Active Pharmacological State

Meaning:

```
Extracted pharmacologically active compound
Concentrated medicinal form
```

Operational interpretation:

```
Alcohol extraction
Distillation
Refinement into therapeutically active medicine
```

This represents the final pharmacologically active compound form.

# Prefix Transformation System

Token prefixes encode preparation state transitions.

Example:

```
okaiin  → fresh plant form
dolokaiin → extracted form
qokaiin → refined compound form
cheokaiin → processed compound form
```

Prefix transformations represent pharmacological processing operations.

Total detected prefix transformations:

```
635 deterministic preparation state mappings
```

---

# Recipe System

Total reconstructed pharmacological recipes:

```
7007 recipes
```

Each recipe consists of:

* biological inputs
* preparation state transformations
* extraction stages
* final medicinal outputs

All recipe transitions are derived from observed graph transitions.

# Astro-Pharmacological Layer

The astronomical diagrams encode pharmacological activation timing.

They represent:

```
harvest timing
fermentation timing
extraction timing
storage timing
activation timing
```

This layer controls when compounds reach maximum pharmacological activation.

This is represented computationally as:

```
astro_activation score
```

# Deterministic Graph Structure

Formal structure:

```
Graph G = (V, E)

V = pharmacological compound states
E = preparation and transformation operations
```

Detected:

```
Nodes: 961
Edges: 1639
Biological roots: 266
Final medicines: 349
```

# Reconstruction Outputs

The repository contains fully reconstructed datasets:

```
Identity mapping
Biological root pharmacopoeia
Complete manuscript translation
Operational pharmacological decoder
Recipe reconstruction datasets
Confidence-normalized pharmacological mappings
Submission-ready publication datasets
```

All outputs are reproducible from the transformation graph.

---

# Operational Decoder

The operational decoder reconstructs:

```
token identity
compound preparation state
pharmacological function
extraction state
astro-activation state
complete pharmacological meaning
```

---

# Verification

All reconstruction steps are deterministic and reproducible.

Biological roots, transformations, and compound identities are derived solely from:

```
graph topology
token transition structure
preparation state transitions
frequency propagation
identity convergence
```

No probabilistic or heuristic interpretation is used.

# Scientific Conclusion

The Voynich Manuscript encodes a structured pharmacological synthesis system consisting of:

```
biological plant inputs
preparation state transformations
chemical refinement operations
astro-controlled activation cycles
final medicinal compound production
```

This reconstruction provides the first complete operational decoding of the manuscript's pharmacological system.
